PART A
Implemented a command line interpreter (shell).

PART B
Implemented an MLFQ scheduler on xv6. A pdf called
graph.pdf shows the graph and provides description. Four cases of
workloads have been considered and these are inspired from the
test cases provided.

A directory has been created for each of the four cases of workloads
which store the information about which process runs at which tick.
The four directories are put in a directory named "plots". Hence to look for
files for the workload named abc, look into xv6/plots/abc
